<b>Co-authored with Kyle Hyndman and Andrew Davis.</b> <br> Waiting is something we encounter daily, whether standing in line at a coffee shop, awaiting a ride-share pickup at the airport, or sitting in a doctor's office. In this study, we examine how different aspects of waiting affect our preferences among service providers. Our findings reveal that people respond negatively to waits that are more uncertain, more skewed, or less well understood."
