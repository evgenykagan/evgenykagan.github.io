<b>Co-authored with Kyle Hyndman and Andrew Davis.</b> <br> We study how people respond to features of waiting that go beyong average waiting times. Our results show that focusing on average waiting times alone oversimplifies behavior. Customers are keenly aware of other aspects of waiting, such as variance, skewness and 'tail thickness' of the waiting time distribution."
