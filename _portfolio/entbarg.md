<b>Co-authored with Kyle Hyndman and Anyan Qi.</b> <br> In this research we study how entrepreneurs and investors divide equity. We use the Nash bargaining framework and test several predictions in the lab.  We find that the number of investors can have either a positive or a negative effect on the ability of the entrepreneur to retain equity in their venture.  Preferred Stock contracts, which are popular in practice, lead to more aggressive
investor bargaining tactics."
