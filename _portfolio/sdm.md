<b>Co-authored with Stephen Leider and Ozge Sahin.</b> <br> In this paper we look at how people make dynamic (sequential) decisions. We examine decision-making in a range of dynamic problems and find, unsurprisingly, that most people are not 'forward-looking optimizers'.  Rather, decision rules depend on the type of environment: decision rules are static in stopping problems (Stop in round X), but are quite sophisticated in other dynamic problems."
