<b>Co-authored with Maqbool Dada and Brett Hathaway.</b> <br> We develop a model of customer service request resolution in contact cetners. We then turn to the broader question of strategic selection of an appropriate mix of service channels: live-agent-only, chatbot-only, or both. We show that the availability of chatbot technology may change request resolution policies with important implications for service quality and cost."
