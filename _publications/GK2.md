title: "Operational Strategies for Customer Service: A Gatekeeper Framework"
collection: publications
excerpt: "This paper develops a model of customer service request resolution in contact centers. This allows us to examine the broader question of strategic selection of an appropriate mix of service channels: live-agent-only, chatbot-only, or both. We show that the availability of chatbot technology may change request resolution policies with important implications for service quality and cost"
