title: "On Repeat: Does Iteration Drive Innovation?"
collection: publications

excerpt: "In this paper we examine how agile development principles (iterative sprints, autonomy) affect innovation performance. We find that frequent iterations help improve performance in complex tasks by increasing exploration behaviors. The main mechanism is slower learning under sequential (non-iterative) workflow."
