  <h3>UTD Rankings and a Possible Extension</h3>

  <p style="font-size: 0.95em;">
    The <a href="https://jsom.utdallas.edu/the-utd-top-100-business-school-research-rankings/">UTD Top 100 Rankings</a> are a very useful public good. I started this side project as a respectful extension of the UTD framework, rather than an alternative to it (and also as a way to explore what can be done with the help of frontier agentic coding models 🤓 ). I made the following additions:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>OM Departments differ in size (and composition).</strong> Size adjustment can be difficult to do directly in the UTD interface. I added productivity adjustment based on OM faculty count.</li>
    <li><strong>Counting.</strong> UTD counts each paper once for each school listed in the affiliations. I included an individual faculty-level view so that multiple same-school coauthors receive multiple credits.</li>
    <li><strong>Citation adjustment.</strong> I also included a citation adjustment to add another view of impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Multidisciplinary journals.</strong> Some journals are inherently multidisciplinary (looking at you, <em>Management Science</em>). Papers need to be classified as OM/OR vs. non-OM/OR. I use a combination of <em>Management Science</em> department labels and GenAI-based predictions for this.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This is only a first step: the current version covers 50 schools, U.S. only, and three operations journals (MS, OR and MSOM). Any comments are welcome!
