  <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Methodology</h3>
  <p><strong>Scope:</strong> 50 U.S. schools and three journals: <em>Management Science</em>, <em>Operations Research</em>, and <em>M&amp;SOM</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Paper classification:</strong> A paper is classified as OM/OR using <em>Management Science</em> departments where OM/OR is typically published (for example, Operations Management, Healthcare, and Optimization). This is augmented by GPT-5.3 inference for papers in other departments. Using this process, <strong>26.8%</strong> of <em>Management Science</em> papers (2016 onward) are classified as OM/OR. For the two core operations journals, the OM/OR shares are <strong>99.1%</strong> for <em>Operations Research</em> and <strong>100.0%</strong> for <em>M&amp;SOM</em>, so the overwhelming majority is included.</p>
  <p><strong>School mapping:</strong> Author affiliations at publication are mapped to ranked schools only when a business-school unit is present in affiliation text. MIT Operations Research Center is included by exception. Postdocs and PhD students are not included in faculty counts.</p>
  <p><strong>Citation source:</strong> <a href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a> only (DOI-based matching; cited_by_count).</p>
  <p><strong>Faculty counts:</strong> Research-track Operations Management / Decision Sciences faculty only (assistant, associate, full). Excludes clinical, teaching-track, emeritus, adjunct, visiting, and practice-track roles.</p>
  <p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Papers (School/Year):</strong> school-level paper credits divided by years in the selected period.</li>
    <li><strong>Papers (Faculty/Year):</strong> author-level paper credits divided by faculty and years.</li>
    <li><strong>Cites/Paper/Year:</strong> total citations divided by school papers and years.</li>
    <li><strong>Papers (Faculty/Year) x Cites/Paper/Year:</strong> product of the two prior rates.</li>
  </ul>
